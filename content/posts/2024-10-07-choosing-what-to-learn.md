I recently found a pretty interesting discussion in one of the chats: 

> What is your behavior in learning? 
> 
> Do you learn the things that you don't know? 
> 
> Or will you join a new course on the topic you know well but want to improve?

Let me share a few points and advices from my experience. 

# 🔖 Bits of theory

- 🖊️ Researchers say that **people tend to practice skills they already know**. Why? Because it is easy, and it feels like you are progressing and accomplishing a new badge after passing another course.

- 🖊️ But to avoid such a situation, you need to remember that **we learn only when we struggle with it**. When we struggle while learning, we strengthen our connections in the brain. Yes, you will have a temptation to stop the practice because it's hard. But that's the natural learning process. So, to progress, you need to choose the weakest topics for you. 

- 🖊️ If you want to know whether you understand the topic, **try explaining** it to others. This can be a knowledge-sharing session or a talk at the conference.

- 🖊️ You can also ask more non-obvious questions at the higher level of [Bloom's taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/): **compare** things one to another or **evaluate** a term under different conditions. 

- 🖊️ Not all knowledge is valuable - so you need to filter out it. You can try splitting it into procedures and concepts. **Procedures** - it is anything that we can describe as a sequence of clearly defined steps. It can be the configuration of a user before testing or implementing certain algorithms. These kinds of skills can be learned only by practicing them repeatedly. (If you need to master it).

- 🖊️ **Concepts** are ideas or terms that require a higher-level understanding. So, instead of memorizing concepts, you need to understand them, find relationships with your current knowledge, and find ways to apply them in practice. 

# 🤔 My practices for learning

- 💡 **Reflect**. Reflect on which work tasks are more challenging for you than others. Where are my gaps in knowledge? Gaps can be in programming, testing, technology, product, or domain knowledge.

- 💡 **Visualize**. Visualize gaps in a diagram or mind map to have a bigger picture of the learning landscape. 

- 💡 **Prioritize**. Choose the most high-priority topics and learn them separately. Focus on at most 1-2 topics at once for a certain amount of time (week, month). 

- 💡 **Note-taking**. I am making notes on almost everything: procedures, concepts, and meetings.

- 💡 **Track**. Track your progress to fight impostor syndrome and to check your status. Write down things you learned: "Now, I can configure a user with a complex set of actions" or "Now, I know how to investigate logs in this particular sub-system."

- 💡 **Evaluate**. Evaluate yourself by implementing a practical project or continuously self-testing the learning topics. 

# As a conclusion

Looking at those steps, I would say that you need to ***treat learning as a project*** and behave like a project manager to plan, do, check, and act in the cycle.

Learning with struggle, building relationships between concepts, reflecting and evaluating - can make new knowledge valuable. Otherwise - it is just copy-pasting concepts from book to your notes (without understanding it).

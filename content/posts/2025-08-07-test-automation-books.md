# ðŸ¤– What to read in test automation?

I often get asked about good books on test automation. I have been reading a lot of books over the years, and I wanted to share my list of good ones for test automation engineers.

**NOTE:** I have not included books on particular tools or frameworks, as they are not relevant for long-term reading.

**One more thing:** I will keep this list updated, so feel free to check it out later.

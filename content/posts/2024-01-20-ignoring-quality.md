# On ignoring the recommendations and quality  
  
## Let me start with a story.  
Imagine a person coming to the doctor with a problem.  
The doctor examines a patient, does an analysis (<ins>conducts tests</ins>, by the way), and comes to a conclusion.

Based on this conclusion, the doctor provides a list of treatments.  
So, the doctor gives the patient information about the current state of an organism (**conclusion**) and provides possible solutions (**list of prescriptions**). Also, the doctor may talk about potential **risks** if the patient ignores those recommendations.  
  
Here lies the question - <ins>**is it a doctor's responsibility if the patient ignores the prescription and chooses not to be treated at all?**</ins>  
The doctor can't control whether the person uses prescribed medicine. (Despite the case if the person is in the hospital). 

So, **if a patient deliberately chooses NOT to be treated**, they take responsibility for possible risks to his health. In this case, a person **can not say that the doctor "did not provide quality treatment.".** The doctors did the job well.  
  
## The same thing happens in the software industry.  
  
Managers, developers, and even testers often claim that the QA engineers' primary responsibility is to "_assure_" quality.  
  
On the one hand - maybe they're right. 

But on the other hand, **it is nearly impossible to assure quality only by yourself** - when management or a team ignores all your information or recommendations.  
  
So, to continue my previous post, the **main goal of a test engineer - is to provide information, recommend improvements, and highlight the risks.**  
  
But when the project is merrily galloping into the abyss, and the team chooses to postpone the quality no matter what - do not blame the tester for all quality problems. It was a **conscious decision**. The team (or management) took this responsibility and risk.  

**What we, as testers, can do - is to make a rescue plan on how to improve quality over time.**
  
*P.S. There are some times when managers or tech leads are unaware of the consequences of bad quality. The test engineers' job is to explain it. So, testers - help your team! Provide examples, draw visuals, use analogies!*  
  
*P.P.S. The more mature team you work with, the fewer explanations you need on why quality matters.*

Hi, my name is Oleksandr and I love to read. 
Today, I wanted to share the list of best books I've read during summer 2024. The books were about software testing and learning. 

# Software Testing

- ðŸ“• Advanced Testing of Systems-of-Systems ["Volume 1: Theoretical Aspects"](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Testing-Systems-Systems-Theoretical/dp/1786307499) and ["Volume 2: Practical Aspects"](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Testing-Systems-Systems-Practical/dp/1786307502) is an interesting read for those who do software testing. It starts by defining a system of systems and then moves on to the approaches and techniques for tackling the verification of such big systems.

- ðŸ“— ["Artificial Intelligence and Software Testing: Building systems you can trust"](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Software-Testing-Black/dp/1780175760) - an excellent and concise book on how to test AI systems and why current approaches are not working for a non-deterministic world. We can also draw some parallels with blockchain systems.

# Learning

- ðŸ“˜ ["Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning"](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013) is a book that presents scientific evidence on why modern education systems are flawed and offers alternative ways to learn and retain information faster. The book is good, but the last third is only about successful application of the author's approaches.

- ðŸ“™ ["Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career"](https://www.amazon.com/Ultralearning-Master-Outsmart-Competition-Accelerate/dp/006285268X) - the book by Scott H. Young, the guy who learned 4-year MIT computer science curriculum - in 1 Year! Here, he explains his methods with much practical advices. 20% of the book is just "inspirational", but the rest - is good.

- ðŸ“• ["Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential"](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Second-Brain-Organize-Potential/dp/1982167386) - As I use note-taking, Obsidian, and PARA methods every day, I have wanted to read the book by Tiago Forte (creator of PARA) for a long time. Some things overlap with two previous books from the list and also with "How to take smart notes." But Tiago explained his approaches in-depth, and it finally made sense to me!

# P.S. 

["Red Rising"](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Rising-1-ebook/dp/B00GIUG3ES) saga from Pierce Brown - one of the best science-fiction books I've read since Asimov's "Foundation". Epic, dynamic, lots of twists - it is definitely worth it to be a movie!

**What about you? What have you read this summer?**
